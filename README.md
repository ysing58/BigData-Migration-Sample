# BigData-Migration-Sample

## Overview
This repository documents a sample migration workflow for moving big data workloads between platforms (e.g., on-prem Hadoop to cloud data lake/warehouse). It focuses on planning, tooling, data validation, and cutover strategy from a Data Engineering perspective.

## Migration Phases
1. Assessment and inventory
2. Target architecture and landing zone setup
3. Data transfer strategy (batch and streaming)
4. Schema and compatibility considerations
5. ETL/ELT refactoring (PySpark)
6. Data validation and reconciliation
7. Orchestration and scheduling
8. Cutover and rollback plan
9. Post-migration monitoring and optimization

## Artifacts
- Migration checklist
- Sample runbook
- Validation plan and metrics
- Risk register and mitigation steps

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data platform migration strategy
- PySpark-based refactoring of ETL jobs
- Data validation and reconciliation
- Orchestration and monitoring

## Author
Designed for Data Engineering/ETL portfolio demonstrations
